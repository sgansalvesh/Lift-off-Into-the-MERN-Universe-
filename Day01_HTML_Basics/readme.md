# üß± Day 1: HTML Basics Showcase

Welcome to Day 1 of my MERN Stack learning journey! Today I focused on mastering the fundamentals of HTML ‚Äî the backbone of web development.

## ‚úÖ What I Learned

### HTML Boilerplate & Semantic Structure
- Understanding the essential HTML document structure:  
  `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- Using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to give meaningful structure to the webpage.

### Headings & Paragraphs
- All heading levels from `<h1>` to `<h6>` and their importance for SEO and accessibility.
- Paragraph tags `<p>` for regular text content.
- Emphasis tags:
  - `<strong>` for strong importance (usually bold)
  - `<em>` for emphasis (usually italic)
  - `<mark>` to highlight text

### Lists
- Ordered lists `<ol>` and unordered lists `<ul>`, and how to nest list items.

### Links
- External links with `<a href="https://...">`
- Email links with `mailto:` and phone links with `tel:` to create clickable email and call actions.
- Bookmarks (internal navigation) using `id` attributes and anchor links to jump within the page.

### Images
- Using `<img>` to embed images.
- Importance of the `alt` attribute for accessibility.
- Difference between local images (stored in project folder) and external images (via URL).

### Embedding YouTube Videos
- Used `<iframe>` to embed a YouTube video.
- Controls like play, pause, and stop are managed by YouTube‚Äôs player interface.
- You can pause the video manually or it will pause automatically when navigating away.

### Semantic Tags
- How semantic tags improve HTML structure and readability.
- Using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to organize content meaningfully.

### Mini Resume Project
- Built a simple resume page including:
  - Name and role (using `<h1>`, `<h3>`)
  - About me section with paragraphs
  - Skills listed in unordered lists
  - Social media links with external URLs
  - Bookmark navigation to jump between resume sections

## üìù Additional Notes

### `div` vs `span`
- `<div>` is a block-level container, meaning it takes up full width and starts on a new line.
- `<span>` is an inline container, used to style or group small parts of text without breaking the flow.

### Bookmarks / Internal Links
- To create an internal link (bookmark), assign an `id` to the target element:
  ```html
  <h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>
creates a header titled "Skills" with the identifier skills. Then this link:
  <a href="#skills">Jump to Skills</a>

### What are `<meta>` Tags?

`<meta>` tags live inside the `<head>` section of your HTML. They provide important **metadata** ‚Äî basically information _about_ your webpage that browsers, search engines, and social media use to understand your site better.

Why are they important? Because they help:

- **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Letting Google and others know what your page is about.  
- **Page description:** Shows a summary below your page‚Äôs title in search results.  
- **Keywords:** Help search engines find your page for relevant searches.  
- **Page behavior:** Like setting the character encoding (`charset`) or viewport for mobile responsiveness.

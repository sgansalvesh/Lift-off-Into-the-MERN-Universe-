# 🚀 Day 3 - CSS Box Model & Display: Inline vs Inline-Block

On Day 3 of my MERN journey, I explored how every HTML element is a box (thanks to the CSS box model!) and how elements behave differently based on their display property like `inline`, `inline-block`, and `block`.

## ✅ What I Learned

### 📦 CSS Box Model
- Understood the four core areas: **Content → Padding → Border → Margin**.
- Learned how padding adds space *inside* the box and margin adds space *outside* it.
- Used browser dev tools to visualize and tweak the box model live.

### 📐 Inline vs Inline-Block vs Block
- `inline` elements (like `<span>`) don't allow width/height and don't break lines.
- `inline-block` elements behave like `inline` but respect height, width, and box model.
- Practiced with divs styled as both to see their layout behavior visually.

### 🎨 CSS Styling Practice
- Used `background-color`, `padding`, `margin`, `border`, and `display` properties.
- Added spacing and visual boundaries to better understand layout differences.

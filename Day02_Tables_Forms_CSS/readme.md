# 🚀 Day 2 - HTML Tables, Forms & Basic CSS

On Day 2 of my MERN journey, I learned to structure content using tables, gather user input through forms, and apply simple styles using CSS.

## ✅ What I Learned

### 📊 HTML Tables
- Used `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` tags.
- Learned to organize tabular data with clean layout.
- Aligned headers and rows clearly for visibility.

### 📝 Forms
- Created a form with text input, email, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a textarea.
- Used `label`, `input`, and `textarea` elements.
- Used the `required` attribute for validation.

### 🎨 Basic CSS
- Applied background color, spacing, padding, and simple styling.
- Linked external stylesheet using `<link>`.
- Targeted table and form elements with CSS selectors.

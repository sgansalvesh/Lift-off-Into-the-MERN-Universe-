# 🚀 Day 2 - Tables, Forms & Basic CSS Styling 

On Day 2 of my MERN journey, I learned how to create advanced tables with semantic tags and built a form with dropdowns, email input, and applied basic but attractive CSS styling.

## ✅ What I Learned

### 📊 Tables
- Used `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`, `colspan`, and `rowspan` for well-structured, semantic tables.
- Created separate sections for table header, body, and footer to improve accessibility and organization.
- Learned to merge cells across rows and columns, align content, and apply consistent styling.
- Styled tables with CSS to enhance readability, including colors, borders, padding, and hover effects for better UX.

### 📝 Forms 
- Built HTML forms including text inputs, email, dropdown selects for subjects, and textarea for messages.
- Used attributes like `required`, `placeholder`, and proper labels for accessibility.
- Added submit and reset buttons.
- Learned the importance of form structure and user-friendly input design.

### 🎨 Basic CSS Styling
- Applied colors, padding, margins, borders, and hover effects to both forms and tables.
- Learned to use selectors, pseudo-classes (`:hover`), and style form elements for better UI.
- Practiced organizing CSS rules for maintainability.

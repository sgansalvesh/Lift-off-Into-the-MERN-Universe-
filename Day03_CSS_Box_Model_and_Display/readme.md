🚀 Day 3 - CSS Box Model & Display: Inline vs Inline-Block
On Day 3 of my MERN journey, I explored how every HTML element is a box (thanks to the CSS box model!) and how elements behave differently based on their display property like inline, inline-block, and block.

✅ What I Learned
📦 CSS Box Model
Understood the four core areas: Content → Padding → Border → Margin.

Learned how padding adds space inside the box and margin adds space outside it.

Used browser dev tools to visualize and tweak the box model live.

📐 Inline vs Inline-Block vs Block
inline elements (like <span>) don't allow width/height and don't break lines.

inline-block elements behave like inline but respect height, width, and box model.

Practiced with divs styled as both to see their layout behavior visually.

🎨 CSS Styling Practice
Used background-color, padding, margin, border, and display properties.

Added spacing and visual boundaries to better understand layout differences.
